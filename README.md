# Jasmine Feedreader Testing

A web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Using Jasmine, we provide an testing environment for the application.
This project is for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.

1. Download the .zip file from GitHub
2. Unzip the archive
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice. 
4. This will run the feedreader and also show the Jasmine tests (all currently passing!).
